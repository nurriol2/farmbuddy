# Farm Buddy 

*This webpage is a variation on [The Odin Project "Recipes" assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).*

I tend to forget exactly what I need or where to go during Farm Runs in Old 
School Runescape. I'm usually doing runs on the mobile version of the game, 
which means I can't use fancy plugins to do my thinking for me.

Then I waste time scrubbing through an example video or pulling up 3-4
different pages on [The Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/).

So instead of actually cleaning my bank, I thought I would spice up this
assignment a little bit and turn it into a personal reference site for myself.
That way I can pull up the link, grab my items, and be on my way.
