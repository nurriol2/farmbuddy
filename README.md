# Farm Buddy 

**Farm Buddy** is a personal reference site for information on the Farming skill in [Old School Runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/).

## Motivation 

I tend to forget exactly what I need or where to go during Farm Runs in Old 
School Runescape. I'm usually doing runs on the mobile version of the game, 
which means I can't use fancy plugins to do my thinking for me.

Instead of actually organizing my bank tabs, I built **Farm Buddy**! 

## The Odin Project

I'm learning front-end development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP). 

**Farm Buddy** is a variation on [the Recipes project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) that is more personally useful.

Completing the project this way allowed me to practice HTML fundamentals while also building something that outlives the end of the assignment.

## Learning Outcomes

By working on **Farm Buddy**, I practiced building a static website from scratch. 

I combined fundamental content tags like headings, paragraphs, and images to logically present useful information.

I implemented basic navigation between pages  with the anchor tag. 

One area I need to improve is formatting the HTML. Coming from other programming languages that I have more experience with, I may use automatic tooling to enforce a formatting I already know. Since HTML is much newer, I think it's best to practice manually formatting for now.

Inspecting the source of websites I visit on a daily basis may give me an idea  of formatting guidelines for HTML documents. I can also search for widely accepted style guides.
